                      which define the scope of the Deal. If you buy a product

                      for the first service and/or product, but the Normal Price
                      for all services and/or products thereafter. Alternatively,

                      other service and/or product that together do not constitute
                      a Bundle Deal, you will pay the Normal Price for all such
